# MetaDataGUI
This GUI organizes and creates AIND metadata for 2p imaging (scanimage) + behavior (pybpod) + videography (pyspincapture) experiments on our Bergamo 2p microscope.


Data is saved on VAST as follows:
-- /allen/aind/scratch/BCI/2p-raw
    -- /mouseWRname
        -/date
            -/behavior
            -/behaviorvideo
            -/pophys
